# SWE590_TaskSchedulingAlgorithms
I have implemented FCFS, Round Robin, and Shortest Job First task scheduling algorithms in this repository using CloudSim. To implement these algorithms, I created data center broker files. I have changed the submitCloudlets() function in DatacenterBroker.java class. I didn't change this file for the FCFS algorithm because the default task scheduling algorithm is FCFS in CloudSim.
